# Tymeshift's PHP code test - Solution ðŸ§ª

In this code test my objective was to introduce changes while maintaining the code structure, opting to avoid introducing extensive changes to the project.

During the process, I addressed all the unfinished elements, even though tests were passing with some incomplete implementations. The only class I didn't get into details was `BaseCollection` as many methods were unused.

I updated the code to align with PHP8 standards and, with full type hinting support, I decided to remove most of the PHPDocs as type hints were sufficient.

In terms of tests, I initially adapted existing tests to standard unit tests. However, as I realized the intent was to test functionalities basically "from end to end", I kept the unit tests while also introducing functional tests. Tests are categorized into separate folders.

While there are more areas worth discussing, I'll keep those for a potential technical interview, assuming you find this solution worthy enough.
